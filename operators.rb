# +	Addition − Adds values on either side of the operator.	a + b will give 30
# −	Subtraction − Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand.	a - b will give -10
# *	Multiplication − Multiplies values on either side of the operator.	a * b will give 200
# /	Division − Divides left hand operand by right hand operand.	b / a will give 2
# %	Modulus − Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder.	b % a will give 0
# **	Exponent − Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators.	a**b will give 10 to the power 20

# Comparrison operators
# <=>	Combined comparison operator. Returns 0 if first operand equals second, 1 if first operand is greater than the second and -1 if first operand is less than the second.	(a <=> b) returns -1.
# ===	Used to test equality within a when clause of a case statement.	(1...10) === 5 returns true.
# .eql?	True if the receiver and argument have both the same type and equal values.	1 == 1.0 returns true, but 1.eql?(1.0) is false.
# equal?	True if the receiver and argument have the same object id.	if aObj is duplicate of bObj then aObj == bObj is true, a.equal?bObj is false but a.equal?aObj is true.
