Hello, this is Manwinder singh
I am a serious programmer but sometimes I fed up from code.
now these days I used to learn ruby programming language.
I am working in MAROPOST as trainee and learning the rules and aspects of the company.
I am not as much good in English
hence I am also improving my English skills too.
regards
Manwinder singh (Trainee)
